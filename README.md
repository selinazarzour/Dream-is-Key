# Motivational Website
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
I built a website using HTML language combining it with CSS and JavaScript.
In the website I put articles about topics such as business, Future Of Work, Health, Quotes
Then I put special videos which are Youtube Videos from my Youtube Channel, using embeded code I copy it and paste it to the html file.
In total I used 11 html files with their css and javascript files.
Unnfortunately I had only 11 hours to finish the finnal project.
I hope you will like it!!
Thank you so much
And this was CS50 :)
