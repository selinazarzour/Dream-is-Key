# Motivational Website
#### Description:
Hello, I’m Selina Zarzour and I’m a grade 12 student at a French high school in Beirut, currently studying my A level in Mathematics and Physics, preparing eagerly to start my next chapter in life at University. Raised in the Lebanese middle eastern culture, multilingual, high energetic girl with an embedded revolution character always challenging the status quo, never stop asking “why”!!. I am very passionate about Technology, Computer Science and Engineering. My mission is to improve human life, to eliminate poverty and hunger from this planet and of course create a positive impact in our society and in our life.

Part of my personal ambition is to contribute and give back to the community.
That is why I build a website using HTML in visual studio code.
Combining 3 languages at the same time: CSS JavaScript and HTML..
In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it’s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
What I consider the best outcome for me is finish creating the software in a limited time and yet should had great content, design and interactivity.

Because I am a motivated person and I am keen to motivate and help other in any way possible. I chose to do that website and relate it to my ambition and passion.
The goal of my website is to motivation any people in the world, and push them forward to think with the best mind and with that mindset anything is possible.
I put a lot of my own work, such as my YouTube channel Videos in the website and a lot of my personal favorites motivational videos.

I built a website using HTML language combining it with CSS and JavaScript.
In the website I put articles about topics such as business, Future Of Work, Health, Quotes
Then I put special videos which are YouTube Videos from my YouTube Channel, using embeded code I copy it and paste it to the html file.
In total I used 11 html files with their CSS and JavaScript files.
The main file is the “index.html” where I put first, my about then some articles put into blocks about business motivation, then the latest articles with reference link.
And as any html it has its own footer..
So Now let’s go in Details:
So first of all, I put a logo for each html file in the header.
Then I put 3 blocks:
Topics, Videos and Special Videos
in which the “topics” has like a dropdown list of 4 things:
-	Business
-	Future Of Work
-	Health
-	Quotes
In the 3 topics, it has the same template where I put a lot of articles.
Then after the topics, in the Videos file I put my own characterisation of my favourites motivational videos for people who like to be motivated by watching videos.
And last but not least, I put a Special Video file when I built my own content, pasted the embedded videos of my own YouTube Channel which are some tutorials not about motivation but my journey with this YouTube account is!!
Unfortunately I had only 11 hours to finish the final project.
I hope you will like it!!
Thank you so much
And this was CS50 :)
