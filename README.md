# Motivational Website
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/upNdC1B-LNI
#### Description:
I built a website using HTML language combining it with CSS and JavaScript.
In the website I put articles about topics such as business, Future Of Work, Health, Quotes
Then I put special videos which are YouTube Videos from my YouTube Channel, using embeded code I copy it and paste it to the html file.
In total I used 11 html files with their CSS and JavaScript files.
The main file is the “index.html” where I put first, my about then some articles put into blocks about business motivation, then the latest articles with reference link.
And as any html it has its own footer..
So Now let’s go in Details:
So first of all, I put a logo for each html file in the header.
Then I put 3 blocks: 
Topics, Videos and Special Videos
in which the “topics” has like a dropdown list of 4 things:
-	Business
-	Future Of Work
-	Health
-	Quotes
  
In the 3 topics, it has the same template where I put a lot of articles.
Then after the topics, in the Videos file I put my own characterisation of my favourites motivational videos for people who like to be motivated by watching videos.
And last but not least, I put a Special Video file when I built my own content, pasted the embedded videos of my own YouTube Channel which are some tutorials not about motivation but my journey with this YouTube account is!!
Unfortunately I had only 11 hours to finish the final project.
I hope you will like it!!
Thank you so much
And this was CS50 :)
